# IAL Project 2: Hashtable and Binary Search Trees

**Course:** Algorithms (IAL)  
**Language:** C  

### 1. **Hashtable (`hashtable/hashtable.c`)** 
   - Implemented a hashtable with operations for insertion, deletion, and lookup.

### 2. **Recursive Binary Search Tree (`btree/rec/btree.c`)**
   - Developed a binary search tree with operations implemented recursively, including insertion, deletion, and search.

### 3. **Iterative Binary Search Tree (`btree/iter/btree.c`)**
   - Implemented a binary search tree with iterative functions for insertion, deletion, and search.
